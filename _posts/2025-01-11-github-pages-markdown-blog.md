# Getting Started with GitHub Pages and Markdown Blogs

As a developer, I've discovered an incredibly simple and cost-effective way to host a blog - using GitHub Pages and Markdown. In this post, I'll walk you through the process of setting up your own blog without spending a dime.

## Why GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages offers:
- Free hosting
- Custom domain support
- Version control for your blog posts
- Easy deployment
- Static site generation

## Writing in Markdown

Markdown makes writing content incredibly simple. Here's a quick example:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2

**Bold text** and *italic text*

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
